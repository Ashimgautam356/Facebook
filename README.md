This project is only done for practice purpose.
This project is done by using html,css,js only 
Well soryy to say but this is not fully responive, yeah you see some responsiveness upto tab/ipad but not in mobile.
so from this i have learned that we should make responsiveness along with building ui. If you think to work first in ui and then work in responsiveness then it makes the work more harder. I will lear from these mistake and bulid some more project which would be better then this own 
Thanks! Ashim
